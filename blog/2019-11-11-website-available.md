## Website release

Today we launch the documentation website.

I want to thank to [Facebook Open Source][facebook-open-source] because their awesome work with [Docusaurus][docusaurus-url], which has made possible to develop the full documentation website in about a pair of days!

We will continue improving the site during next days.
