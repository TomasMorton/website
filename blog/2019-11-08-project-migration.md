## Acknowledgement

This projects has been forked from the [XByOrange Mocks Server](https://github.com/XbyOrange/mocks-server) by me, its author and main maintainer while I was working in the company.

I've taken this decission with the intention of continuing evolving and maintaining it without the dependency of the company. But I also want to thank the company and team colleagues for trusting in me and leave me implement this tool for his front-end development team.

It demostrated to be a great tool for the front-end team, that maked the development and acceptance tests environments more agile and flexible, and less dependant of back-end teams.

I will continue the project with the hope of they will still continue using it, and taking rise of the new features I have planned to implement.

In order to facilitate their migration to this new project, I will maintain all olds interfaces with no breaking changes for the most time possible.
