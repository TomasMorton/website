## Introducing behaviors

A new version has been released today. Fixing a "semantic" issue that was waiting for a long time, because it was related only with the "naming" of the Mocks Server "behaviors".

Before this release the "behavior" concept was called "feature", which was really confusing.

As this project is intended for public use now, I think the most important thing to do first was making it clearer and more understandable.

Old "Feature" constructors and options remains also for compatibility with previous versions, but had been removed from the documentation.
