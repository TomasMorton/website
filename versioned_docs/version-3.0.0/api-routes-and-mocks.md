## Preface

The main concepts to understand when working with Mocks Server are `Routes`, `Route variants` and `Mocks`. That's why their APIs are explained in the "Get started" section.

## Routes

Read the [Routes chapter in the "Get started"](get-started-routes.md) section for a detailed explanation about how to define routes and all of its available properties.

## Mocks

Read the [Mocks chapter in the "Get started"](get-started-mocks.md) section for a detailed explanation about how to define mocks and all of its available properties.
